 c. Text analysis: Your program should read the text file, count the
 number of words, and calculate the average word length for each file.
 d. Log the analysis results using a logging API (e.g., Log4j or java
 .util.logging). The log entry should include the file name, the number
 of words, and the average word length.e. Use a thread pool of Executors
 to control the number of concurrent file processing threads. Configure
 the thread pool to have a maximum of, for example, 4 threads.
 f. After processing all text files, generate a summary log that includes
 the total number of files processed and the average word length across all files.
 Ensure proper error handling for file operations, such as handling exceptions if
 a file cannot be read.Your Java program should utilize I/O Streams for reading the
  text files, a logging API for logging results, and Executors to manage concurrent
  file processing. The program should be modular, well-structured, and efficient.
