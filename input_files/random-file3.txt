 c. Text analysis: Your program should read the text file, count the
 number of words, and calculate the average word length for each file.
 d. Log the analysis results using a logging API (e.g., Log4j or java
 .util.logging). The log entry should include the file name, the number
 of words,andtheaverageword length.e. Use a thread pool of Executors
 tocontrolthe numberofconcurrentfileprocessing threads. Configure
 thethreadpooltohave a maximum of, for example, 4 threads.
 f. After processingalltextfiles,generate a summary log that includes
 the total number of files processedandtheaverage word length across all files.
 Ensure propererrorhandling for file operations, such as handling exceptions if
 a file cannotberead.Your Java program should utilize I/O Streams for reading the
  text files, alogging API for logging results, and Executors to manage concurrent
  file processing. The program should be modular, well-structured, and efficient.
